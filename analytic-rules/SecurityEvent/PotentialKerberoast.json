        "description": "'A service principal name (SPN) is used to uniquely identify a service instance in a Windows environment. \nEach SPN is usually associated with a service account. Organizations may have used service accounts with weak passwords in their environment. \nAn attacker can try requesting Kerberos ticket-granting service (TGS) service tickets for any SPN from a domain controller (DC) which contains \na hash of the Service account. This can then be used for offline cracking. This hunting query looks for accounts that are generating excessive \nrequests to different resources within the last hour compared with the previous 24 hours.  Normal users would not make an unusually large number \nof request within a small time window. This is based on 4769 events which can be very noisy so environment based tweaking might be needed.'\n",
